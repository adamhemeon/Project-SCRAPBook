## How to contribute to SCRAPBook

#### **Are you not already a contributor?**
* SCRAPBook is an Nova Scotia Community College student project for the 2nd year IT Programming - Capstone 3000 course. 
* This project is closed to new contributors until the end of the Winter 2021 semester.
* Feel free to take the source code as it becomes available and use it as you see fit within the constraints of the project license(https://github.com/adamhemeon/Project-SCRAPBook/blob/main/LICENSE).

#### **Will I be able to contribute in the future?**
* Yes! The aim is to open SCRAPBook to any and all contributors after the final semester of our program and our course requirements have been fulfilled.

#### **Are you already a contributor?**
* Make small atomic commits. The more commits the better when the time comes to merge branches back to main.
* Never commit to the main branch. Each contributor's code will live on a separate branch named for the functionality they will be working on. ex. branch user-interface-1
* Merges to main will be discussed in weekly SCRUM before taking place to help ensure and protect the stability of the main build.
* Merges will be performed during live code review with the contributor and repository owner to help minimize bugs and merge conflicts.

Thanks!
