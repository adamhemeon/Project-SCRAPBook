# About

SCRAPBook is an Android game built with Android Studio that takes the gameplay of a classic Rock, Paper, Scissors game and incorporates users' photos and color analysis to win.

##**Why do I need to give camera permission to SCRAPBook?**

This game requires permission to access your photo gallery and camera to fully work. It uses the photos you choose to play the game against a saved bank of stock photos.

##**What happens to my photos?**

They stay on your device, are never saved, and are only used to play the game! SCRAPBook does not collect or save your photos in any way. 

##**How do I win?**

SCRAPBook compares the RGB color value of each photo in succession and assigns it Red, Blue, or Green based on the majority percentage of that color in the photo. 

Red beats Green. Green beats Blue. Blue beats Red.

##**Can I play with my friends?**

Right now it’s just you versus the computer.

Introducing a connection to the internet and sending your photos over the web could compromise the security of your photos! If we release online play we want users’ security to be our top priority and do it right.

##**Who made this game?**

SCRAPBook was started as a Nova Scotia Community College student project for the IT Programming INFT 3000 Capstone course at the Halifax, NS IT Campus. 

Project group: Adam Hemeon, Brady Getson, Craysyn Trottier, Jayden Morehouse, Kieran London
